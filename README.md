# background-generator
This is a JavaScript single page application for generating and testing different background color gradient options for use in on your websites.  This project was designed and developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.   This application allows you choose two different colors to use in the gradient and displays them on the background to allow you to see how well they look together.  This application also has a “random” button you can use to generator random color combinations to help you test out different background options.  The rgb color codes used are displayed on the screen inyou to reference and use on your webpage once you have decided on a combination that works for your project.
